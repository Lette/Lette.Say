`Lette.Say`

#### You don't Say? ####

I got jealous of my Mac-wielding friend who had a console app that could speak so I built my own that does the same thing.

#### Usage ####

| Command Line        | Description
|:------------------- |:----------------------------
| `say Hello, World!` | speaks a single line of text
| `say -f file.txt`   | speaks line by line from a file
| `say -F file.txt`   | speaks line by line from a file and prints those lines to stdout as well
